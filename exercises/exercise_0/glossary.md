| Terminology           | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| dataframe             |A data frame is the core structure in Pandas. Think of it like a table in Excel or SQL; It has rows and columns
| series                |A Series is a single column of data in Pandas. It's like a one-dimensional array with labels
| pandas concat         |"pd.concat()" is used to combine multiple DataFrames or Series along a particular axis (rows or columns)   |
| pandas apply          |"apply()" lets you apply a function to each row or column in a DataFrame or Series             |
| csv                   |CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. It's a common file format for storing tabular data             |
| pandas isnull         |"isnull()" checks for missing values (NaNs) in a DataFrame or Series             |
| masking in pandas     |Masking means using a condition to filter data.             |
| pandas transpose      |"transpose()" flips the rows and columns of a DataFrame. Useful for when you want to reorient your data for analysis or presentation.             |
| pandas value_counts() |"value.counts()" counts how often each unique value appears in a Series. Great for summarizing categorical data.             |
| json                  |JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a structured format used to store and exchange data, especially in web applications.             |
| tabular data          |Tabular data is data arranged in rows and columns, like a spreadsheet or database table.             |
| zero-based indexing   |Zero-based indexing means counting start at 0(zero). In Python and Pandas, the first element is accessed with index 0.             |
| join                  |A join combines rows from two tables based on a shared column. It's used to merge related data from different tables.             |
| left join             |A left join keeps all rows from the left table and adds matching rows from the right table. Unmatched rows from the right table are filled with NaN.             |
| inner join            |An inner join keeps only rows that have matching values in both tables. It's used to focus on shared data.             |
| group by              |"groupby()" groups data based on column values and lets you apply aggregation functions like "sum()" or "mean()".             |
